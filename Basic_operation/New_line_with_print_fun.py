print("The itsy bitsy spider climbed up the waterspout.")
print()
print("Down came the rain and washed the spider out.")


# TO print the "/" we use "//" coz "/" is escape sequence 

print("\\") 

# print("\") gives ---> SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal



# comma is just used to pass multiple arguments still print() treats it same as single argument 

print("The itsy bitsy spider" , "climbed up" , "the waterspout.")


#using end="/n" prints same as default print

print("My name is", "Python.", end="\n")
print("Monty Python.")


#using end=" "

print("My name is", "Python.", end=" ")
print("Monty Python.")


#using end="" removing the space b/w "" will print as continuous line.

print("My name is ", end="")
print("Monty Python.")
